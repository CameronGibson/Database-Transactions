# Database-Transactions

Stack - ASP.NET Core(server), SSMS(database), Angular 11(Client)

This single page application is purely for performing CRUD operations. The data is displayed and manipulated from interation with the client. The HttpClientModule
consumes the exposed RESTful api within the ASP.NET Core server which then will perform database manipulation which will then be displayed back to the client upon completion. 

There isn't really any rhyme or reason to creating this application. It does nothing spectacular but I thought it might be nice to try building out a full stack application with
C# instead of my usual goto which would have been Java. I can say with certainty that I enjoyed creating the REST api in ASP.NET more than Spring Boot 2.
